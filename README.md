# Create your Personal Project Page
In this series of steps, you'll utilize an existing CSS to create a webpage to serve as your mobile resume. 

## Pick Your Style
The current color scheme is listed at the top of the `style.css` file. Take some time to decide on a color scheme you would like to use. Stick with 2 to 4 colors beyond the background color. Search [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) or [W3Schools Pallettes](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_palettes.asp). Change all the existing colors in the `style.css` page to use your selected colors. 

There are two font styles chosen so far: Lucida Sans and Courier New. As each web browser supports different font styles, you'll notice that several fonts are listed for each selection. The browser will attempt to load the first font. If it cannot be found, then it will go down the list until it finds a supported font. 

```
    font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
```
Search [CSS fonts](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/fonts.en.html) for fonts to choose from and the accepted default if it is not supported. Replace the `font-family` with your desired font. 




From this project, you can branch off to add extra pages. At least one page should be devoted to your own projects you have made.
